This is a JavaScript, React, and React Hooks interface project for COVID-19 tracking across different countries throughout the past few months. It utilizes Mathdroid's COVID-19 API (https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api) which has a comprehensive data set of all the infected, recovered, and deaths numbers of most of the countries in the past 70 days. 

It incorporates different libraries such as axios data fetching, react-chartjs-2 for the chart visualization, MaterialUI for general interfacing and responsiveness(for desktop and mobile).
